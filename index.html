                    <p id="AraTitle">Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Kyoto</p>
                    <p id="indent">The green bamboo of Arashiyama, swaying in a gentle breeze, is a hypnotic sight. No wonder this serene, shady forest has captured the imagination of poets and artists for hundreds of years. There’s almost perfect symmetry as you wander along the path, almost impossibly tall, slender bamboos arching gracefully overhead.

                    The Arashiyama Mountains are a scenic area on the western outskirts of Kyoto. It’s a popular area for hiking and cycling, with trails running through the bamboo forest.
                    
                    The grove is outside Tenryuji, a Buddhist temple established in 1339. That took the place of a ninth century one that was Japan’s first Zen temple.
                    
                    Another nearby landmark is the scenic Togetsukyo (“Moon Crossing Bridge”) which originally dated to 836. There are a number of souvenir shops on the bridge and rickshaw rides are a popular way to cross it.</p>

                    <p id="FujiTitle">Mount Fuji, Shimizu</p>
                    <p id="indent">No list of Japan landmarks would be complete without Mount Fuji, whose image fills paintings, photos and posters in every souvenir shop. Its near-perfect cone, the tallest peak in Japan, looks even lovelier topped with snow in winter.
                    One of the best places to see it is Oshino Hakkai, once a point to start a pilgrimage up the sacred Japanese mountain. It has eight ponds, eight being a significant number in Buddhism, which are fed by water from the mountain’s snow.
                    In summer, the climb to the 12,380-ft summit attracts thousands of hikers. Many start at night just to see the sunrise here. This sunrise, in the “Land of the Rising Sun”, is very special. Called “Goraiko” (Great Sunrise), it’s something many Japanese wish to experience once.</p>
